**Development has come to a halt. Support for this program has stopped. over time this program will stop working as Google updates their Youtube API. If you want you can still submit bug reports however they will go ignored for the time being.**

This program i wrote in java will let you to take advantage of windows task scheduler and allow you to schedule when you want your video to be uploaded to Youtube.

You will have to choose the option to store your Youtube username and password if you want the scheduler to work. You will also have to leave your computer turned on during the time that it is to be uploaded. And for the time being you will have to leave your computer logged in during your scheduled upload. I highly recomend that you sign up for 2-way google authentication and get an application specific password for YtuScheduler. You can do this [here.](https://accounts.google.com/IssuedAuthSubTokens)

This program has only been tested on windows 7 (64). I suspect that it will work on any windows 7 & vista computers.

Here is an overview of the program: [YouTube link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hXFH4mNctk)



wiki:video: cannot find YouTube video id within parameter "url".




You need java run-time environment 7 ( JRE 7 ) to run the pre-compiled jar.

You will need Youtube's API library and it's dependency to compile the program yourself.

I must point out that the youtube API requires a developer key to upload from programs such as this. One thing a developer can do is attach tags to every video uploaded with his program. This tag is only viewable by anyone who knows both the developer's key and the tags - which allows the developer to search for, and find, anyone who has every uploaded a video with his program. I have chosen to not place a tag on videos uploaded with this program.
